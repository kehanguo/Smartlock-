# Smartlock-This is a smartlock program. 
The emailreceive.py program works with a pi camera and infrared sensor. The picamera is directly connected with the camera port in raspberry pi. As for our project, we used raspberry pi model B+. For the raspberry pi GPIOs, Pin1 is connected to IR power port, Pin23 is the sensing port and ground should be connected to pin6.
